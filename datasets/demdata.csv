I understand that things are dire, and that candidates across our country need money, but this is ridiculous.  It's gotten to the point where I'm still going to vote Dem, but I don't feel like financially supporting anyone in the party ever again.

There are just so many more issues than abortion in which to base a decision on it is frustrating not being made aware of different candidates' or partys' positions on other issues.

Every commercial I've seen from the Democrat side is focused on abortion and January 6th. That is it. Two, albeit very important, issues when there are just so many more issues at hand.

What are the Democrats positions on: rampant inflation, taxes, the recession, spending, national debt, our southern border, gang violence, foreign relations (specifically the UN, China, Russia, and Ukraine), homelessness, national defense, legalization of marijuana, importation of illegal hard drugs, prescription medication prices, medical costs, post-secondary education costs, funding primary &amp; secondary education, nursing shortage (my daughter is a CNA/NT &amp; nursing student :) ), and I could keep going but that should give me enough information to base my votes on."

Today, someone in the No Stupid Questions sub asked ""what caused the Civil War.""

I use [this page](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp) regularly with people who have been confused about this topic. Also, I use with it people who think ""states' rights"" is the answer to everything or want to discount the impact of racism in US history.

There's no point in extended debates on these topics. The words used by the actual people who made decisions that led us to war are 100% clear.

By the way, outside the Capitol Building in Austin, you'll find a monument to confederate soldiers. Jefferson Davis stands at the top. It was erected in 1903. Comparing the inscription on the monument (below) with the actual text of the secession document would be comical if it weren't so enraging. Unfortunately, this is what kids and other visitors to the Texas Capitol learn about the Civil War.

67,democrats,joe biden reminds me of a version if hitler that never rose to power in the right time frame.,"Mostly when you learn about fascism, and the nazi germany era of WW2 hitler is the staple of evil of a man who caused a holocaust, and really destoryed a country from the root of morals,   physical lives, other countries and divided its own nation as well.  Joe biden is sorta a failed verson of that man of character.

You feel see it in his prime of age when he would feed off of stolen speeches and work,  was a segregationist, racism, was writing thoes very cruel  crime bills targeting  groups of people.  He was a like minded person akin to adolf hitler.   Just a man who was trying to punish the people keeping the country out of line and tugging on the string of popularity. Fortunately he never rose to be anything other than a democratic scape goat of pretty much filler.  ( joe beiden cant do anything other than fill a blank void of a human that nobody else could be found to do or nobody wanted to do) that upheld the commin goal of the democratic party.   And he often found himself in time losing his cognitive ability to do much of anytjing he truly desired to do but mostly hes such a docile temperament hes often lost his common goal but trying pander his way into power to achive it. Hes burnt out thankfully.   But had was had a 40 year old joe biden in presidential office and not a 80 yeard old one.   There would have been clearly a stronger suffering of black people around the 80s and 90s that wouldnt have not been recovered. 

Makes me wonder somtimes what would have happend to germany if hitler either A died in WW1 or B hitler rose to power post depression and was older around the 1960s or even early 1970s. Would we have seen a off in constant leader bouncing from pandering and hiding whats really sinister due to lack of not wisdom from age but capabilities."

However, whenever I see someone complaining (usually in bad faith) that they paid all of their loans off, and ask ""where's my money?,"" I can't help but slightly agree (for different reasons).

I grew up in a middle class family. My parents were able to save enough over 20 years to be able to fully pay for my education as well as my sibling's. They did have to make some sacrifices. They drove cars that were older than their kids. They bought a home and put off renovations they wanted (they still had some shag carpet and linoleum until a couple years ago). We only went on a couple vacations. We didn't go to the doctor unless it was absolutely necessary. They won't be able to retire when they hit 65 in a few years.

And yes, I know that some people don't have any cars, some people don't have a home at all, and some people never went on any vacations. I am grateful that my family was better off. 

Whenever I see articles about the student loan forgiveness, I think about my parents who could really use $20,000 from putting two kids though college. It makes me feel kind of gross since it puts me in the ""where's my money?"" camp, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there."

91,democrats,Are you paying attention to your local school board races?,"Howdy from Texas, y'all (cringe).

I'm a native Texan &amp; a democrat and I want to shed some light on a situation that we have down here that may also be happening in your neck of the woods.

Local school boards in Texas and all across the country are under attack by radical right-wing actors backed by big-money donors. The school district where my child goes to school is Round Rock ISD. For those who may not know, Round Rock ISD is a suburb North of Austin and it spans both Williamson and Travis counties. Travis county is a blue county and Williamson county was historically red up until the last decade or so (now purple). Like a lot of school boards, the school board positions in our district are supposed to be non-partisan. Unfortunately, in 2020 we had two radical right-wing conservatives who were elected to our school board after running as much more moderate/non-partisan. Since being elected, these two trustees have done a lot of damage to the district by creating havoc in board meetings and fueling lawsuits against the district from right-wing members of the community. They've taken board focus away from serving the students in the district and their supporters have made a mockery of our school board meetings.

Our school board is made up of seven trustees and this year the five trustees who aren't radical conservative are up for election. The two radical conservative board members are actively supporting a slate of five candidates in an attempt to take over total control of the school board. They only need two seats to hold the majority, which would be a disaster for our wonderful school district. Of the five in the slate, one is an ex-Austin City Council member who [lost custody of his child due to child abuse](https://theaustinbulldog.org/candidate-lost-custody-over-abuse-2/). He has a history of being overtly racist and anti-LGTBQIA2S+. His [campaign signs](https://i.redd.it/5b7w9p4vu4j91.jpg) read ""Teach ABCs + 123s Not CRTs &amp; LGBTs."" Another slate candidate [plead guilty to a 3rd-degree felony](https://twitter.com/CognitaVagabond/status/1561673442344280069) after stealing $34,000 from her employer by depositing business checks into her personal account. Yet another slate member [has language on his website](https://imgur.com/a/Nre9rQq) that is transphobic and he blatantly states that he's against teaching anti-racism. The other two are fully supportive of these three and there are other issues with them as well. Aside from the slate, there is another candidate running as a moderate alternative to one of the slate members, but [she is a q-anon follower](https://imgur.com/a/Oy3QUaE) who was responsible for donating ""In God We Trust"" signs to take advantage of Texas' law requiring school districts to display such signs if they are donated.

**Call to action:**

1. Look into your local school board races and get to know the candidates, so that you're informed about who you're voting for in those races. I have personally been guilty of going to the polls and ignorantly voting for school board candidates, not knowing who they are or what they stand for. Never again!
2. We're in a world of hurt if even two of these candidates get elected to our school board. We're fighting like hell to stop them, but they are well-funded. If you want to help us with our fight, please consider [donating to Access Education RRISD](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/accessrrisd). $1, $5, $100 - Anything helps! Access Education RRISD is a PAC that believes that public education should be safe &amp; accessible for ALL students. Donations to Access Education RRISD will be used to support Round Rock ISD candidates who are committed to these values. If you would like to know more about Access Education RRISD, please visit [https://accessrrisd.org/](https://accessrrisd.org/) (note: .org, NOT .com). If you are interested in donating to help our fight but uneasy about donating to a PAC, let me know and I can give you some direct links to campaigns that you could donate to.

TL;DR: Our school board is under attack by people who hate public education, diversity, and inclusion. Do you know who is running for the school board in your school district?"

Biden is likely a shoe in for 2024, but after that, we need the modern day equivalent of JFK - our optic need to get better and stronger! who are some realistic contenders?","Obama was kinda close, but there was no follow up, and as much as I like the dude, not much was accomplished politically. 

Hillary was a meh choice and a polarizing figure in the party. 

Biden just barely won by the skin of his teeth, and he‚Äôs so passive that Roe v Wade got overturned right under his nose. 

unfortunately given the current political climate in the US, we aren‚Äôt ready for a female president. it‚Äôs too polarizing. same with any POC, unfortunately. as those will be the right‚Äôs entire talking points and attacks (as seen with Obama and AOC.) 

we need a white, male candidate that is ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, conventionally attractive and charming. the quintessential ‚Äúall american,‚Äù played football in HS/college or military service is even better.  upper middle class. no scandals. well educated and able to debate and ‚Äúclap back.‚Äù fiery, think male version of AOC, but just a hair more moderate to be palatable. justin trudeau but without the blackface. he‚Äôs gotta be squeaky clean. hell, even an intelligent celebrity sort of figure pulling the ‚Äúi‚Äôm not a politician‚Äù spiel. 

and a killer PR team. 

as long as we have ancient dems who don‚Äôt accomplish anything, the more people get radicalized. the right is successful because they are cutthroat and do crazy shit. and they‚Äôre aggressive and play the game. and dems take the high road and so no one takes them seriously and the party stays stagnant. 

think frank underwood without the sex and murder scandals lmao. 

who could/would make a good realistic candidate for 2024/2028? 

for me, Gavin Newsom was pretty good with his freedom spiel. if not him, he‚Äôs a good ‚Äúblueprint.‚Äù"

- Charges could still be filed under seal before the election. 

Federal prosecutors are likely to wait until after the November election to announce any charges against Donald Trump, if they determine he broke laws, according to people familiar.

The unprecedented prospect of bringing charges against a former US president is creating intense scrutiny of the Justice Department in the aftermath of its search of his home at Mar-a-Lago. A separate DOJ probe is focused on his effort to overturn the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden.

Under long-standing department policy, prosecutors are barred from taking investigative steps or filing charges for the purpose of affecting an election or helping a candidate or party, traditionally 60 days before an election. This year, that would be by Sept. 10, which makes it unlikely anything would be announced until after Nov. 8, said people who asked to remain anonymous speaking about potential Justice Department actions.

To be sure, the department has ignored that policy in recent years with moves interpreted as political interference. Most notable was when former FBI Director James Comey revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was reopening a probe into Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server just days before the 2016 presidential election, which critics say damaged her campaign.

And in 2020, former Attorney General William Barr announced in the weeks before the presidential election that department officials could make public announcements and take overt investigative steps with regard to voter fraud cases, a move seen as amplifying Trump‚Äôs unsupported narrative that there was massive voter fraud.

The latest in global politicsGet insight from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.
This time around, the impact of any criminal case against Trump would likely be significant. While he isn‚Äôt on the ballot in November, Trump has endorsed candidates who are, and he leads a fierce political movement. He recently demanded that he be reinstated as president or a new election held. Trump also might declare he‚Äôs running for president prior to November, which would make him the instant frontrunner for the Republican nomination. 

It‚Äôs not clear if any of the investigations into Trump will have reached the point by November that a decision on charging him could be made, according to two of the people who asked to remain anonymous. And the department isn‚Äôt facing any urgent charging deadlines that must be met before November, they said.

However, nothing stops investigators from taking non-public actions in their investigations, which could include obtaining indictments under seal.

Attorney General Merrick Garland took over the department with a pledge to keep investigations free of political interference and to restore the agency‚Äôs independence and integrity. In May, he issued a memo stating that the election-year policy applies to the 2022 midterms.

‚ÄúSimply put, partisan politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges,‚Äù Garland said in the memo. The Justice Department declined further comment.

The department has chronicled its investigative steps in recent court filings. In a filing late Tuesday, the department said it developed evidence that White House records held in a storage room at Trump‚Äôs Florida home may have been concealed or removed before a June FBI visit to collect classified documents, suggesting possible attempts to obstruct the investigation.

The FBI executed a search warrant on Trump‚Äôs home Aug. 8, when agents removed 20 boxes of material containing 11 sets of classified materials, according to another filing.

Announcing charges against Trump prior to the election likely would be seen as a political ploy by his supporters to damage him and his endorsed candidates, and could fuel unrest in the country.

South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, for example, recently warned during an interview on Fox News ‚Äúthere literally will be riots in the street‚Äù if Trump is indicted for mishandling classified information. Trump immediately posted the clip to his social-media site.

The department is still in the early stages of investigating whether Trump broke any laws with regard to the classified documents, Jay Bratt, chief of the department‚Äôs counterintelligence and export control section, said during a recent court hearing."

204,democrats,"Trump team likely sought to conceal classified docs at Mar-a-Lago, DOJ tells judge.","The 36-page filing was the department‚Äôs most detailed account yet of its evidence of obstruction of justice.

Even if there were circumstances in which a former president could assert privilege, Bratt argues, this scenario would not come close. Intelligence officials are currently reviewing the recovered files to assess risks to national security, and any disruption to that could jeopardize the review, DOJ contends.

The Justice Department also noted that at a June 3 meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Trump‚Äôs aides treated the documents as though they remained classified, never contending that Trump had actually declassified them and producing some in ‚Äúa single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape.‚Äù

A Trump attorney then asserted in a certification letter to the government: ‚ÄúA diligent search was conducted of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Florida‚Äù and that ‚Äúany and all responsive documents accompany this certification.‚Äù At the meeting, Trump‚Äôs attorneys insisted that no subpoenaed documents were held in any other parts of the property but ‚Äúexplicitly prohibited government personnel from opening or looking inside any of the boxes that remained in the storage room.‚Äù

The filing is the Justice Department‚Äôs first response to Trump‚Äôs legal bid to dampen the ongoing DOJ investigation into his retention of highly classified documents in an unsecured storeroom and elsewhere at Mar-a-Lago."
205,democrats,DOJ says special master in Trump case would harm national security interests,"The Justice Department's filing came in response to a motion from Donald Trump for a third party to review the documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Justice Department on Tuesday night said that appointing a special master ""is unnecessary and would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.""

The DOJ attempted to bolster its case to the court by including an FBI photo showing documents and ""classified cover sheets recovered from a container"" in Trump's ""45 office,"" a reference to Trump being the 45th president. The photo shows documents marked ‚Äúsecret‚Äù and ‚Äútop secret‚Äù and ‚ÄúSCI‚Äù ‚Äîwhich stands for highly classified ‚Äúsensitive compartmented information.‚Äù

In its late-night court filing, the Justice Department said that some of the documents seized were so sensitive and classified that FBI agents and DOJ attorneys needed additional security clearances to review them.

The filing came in response to former President Donald Trump‚Äòs request Aug. 22 ‚Äî two weeks after the Mar-a-Lago search ‚Äî for a special master to review the documents seized from his Florida estate.

Justice officials said that the appointment of a special master would impede the government‚Äôs ongoing criminal investigation.

Such a review of classified documents ‚Äúwould impede the Intelligence Community from conducting its ongoing review of the national security risk that improper storage of these highly sensitive materials may have caused and from identifying measures to rectify or mitigate any damage that improper storage caused,‚Äù the DOJ document states.

The Justice Department said it could not trust information that came from Trump's orbit ahead of the Florida search and that a representative for the former president falsely asserted that classified documents had been turned over to the government. The fact that so many documents were found ""casts serious doubt"" on the Trump team's claim that there had been ""a diligent search"" for documents responsive to the grand jury subpoena in May.

""That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President‚Äôs counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,"" the Justice Department said in the filing.

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, signaled over the weekend that she was inclined to grant the former president's request and appoint a third party to review the documents to ensure they don't contain information protected by attorney-client privilege. The Justice Department has said that a government filter team that's separate from the investigation had already identified ""a limited set of materials"" potentially containing privileged information.

In Tuesday night‚Äôs filing, the Justice Department argued a special master is unnecessary because government review teams have already finished their work. ‚ÄúIt would do little or nothing to protect any legitimate interests that Plaintiff may have while impeding the government‚Äôs ongoing criminal investigation,‚Äù the DOJ filing says.

Ahead of Tuesday night's filing, the Justice Department had asked permission to file a response of up to 40 pages to Trump's special master request ‚Äúin order to adequately address the legal and factual issues raised‚Äù by Trump‚Äôs legal team.

The FBI search of Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8 came after extensive discussions with the National Archives and Justice Department officials over nearly 18 months.

A redacted affidavit that laid out probable cause for the search revealed that the National Archives referred the matter to the FBI after it found ""a lot of classified records"" in 15 boxes that Trump turned over to the National Archives earlier this year. A subsequent FBI review of the boxes in May showed that 14 of the 15 boxes contained documents with classification markings. A total of 184 unique documents bearing classification markings were found, including 25 marked ""TOP SECRET.""

The FBI was authorized to seize any documents with classified markings, along with the containers the classified documents were found in, along with any government or presidential records created during Trump's time in office and any ""evidence of knowing alteration, destruction, or concealment of any government and/or Presidential Records, or any documents with classification markings.""

Among the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago were Roger Stone's clemency paperwork, information about the president of France, and a trove of confidential and classified documents, along with presidential records. FBI agents seized 26 boxes, as well as a leather-bound box of documents containing Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information, according to the property receipt of items recovered.

In a separate filing Tuesday, several former federal prosecutors who served during Republican administrations ‚Äî Donald B. Ayer, Gregory A. Brower, John J. Farmer Jr., Stuart M. Gerson, Peter D. Keisler, William F. Weld, and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman ‚Äî wrote that ""regardless of one‚Äôs political views, it is clear that there is no legal support for the relief requested by the former President."""

219,democrats,Republican Party refusing to pay Trump's legal bills over Mar-a-Lago documents scandal,"GOP donors footed the bill in past Trump investigations but he's on his own in classified documents scandal. 

ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl wrote in his post-Donald Trump administration book that on Jan. 20, as Trump was flying from the White House for the final time, he spoke to the head of the Republican Party and threatened to start his own party. RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel reportedly told Trump that if he started a third party that the RNC would stop paying his legal bills, which were costing the party millions.

Politico reported Tuesday, however, that that decision has ended. According to the report, any legal fees having to do with Trump's retention of government documents are not being paid by the RNC.

The report explained that Trump hired Chris Kise, a former Florida solicitor general, to represent him in the FBI search case, it was announced on Tuesday. Thus far, Trump has suffered with a legal team that is moving quickly to appear on television but not in filing a legal defense for their client.

Christina Bobb may be under her own legal problems after signing court documents saying that Trump had already turned over all of the documents. That turned out to be false.

Thus far, the legal team has argued that Trump isn't bound by the laws about handling classified material or stealing government documents. Sources close to Trump revealed that on multiple occasions he shouted, ""They're mine!"" That's false. As with past presidents, the presidential library will be able to possess papers, but not until they go through the archiving process from the National Archives. The government agency manages the documents even if they're in a presidential library, they explained in a press release dispelling Trump's accusation that Barack Obama stole 30,000 documents.

Politico also reported that for his legal services, Kise will be paid by Trump, who regularly stiffs lawyers and business partners when it comes time to sign off on the bill.

""A person familiar with the matter confirmed that the Republican National Committee is not paying for Trump's legal fees related to the FBI's investigation and retrieval of documents at Mar-a-Lago,"" Politico reported. ""That's a departure of sorts from the past. The RNC has, for example, paid for Trump's legal bills involving New York Attorney General Tish James' investigation into the former president's private businesses. The committee would stop paying Trump's legal fees should he formally declare his candidacy for president in the 2024 election ‚Äî a step he has hinted at but has yet to take.""

In the past, Trump has said that he can't announce for president ""yet"" because doing so would start a lot of campaign finance things in motion. In reality, what would be set in motion is that his legal fees couldn't be covered by the RNC because he isn't the GOP nominee. Declaring also means he would no longer be able to raise money into a super PAC. He would be restricted to only raising money into a presidential campaign."

Haines‚Äô response came on the same day that a federal judge unsealed a redacted version of the affidavit that laid out the Justice Department‚Äôs justification for obtaining a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit revealed that prosecutors believed Trump was holding a range of top-secret documents at his private residence, including some of the former president‚Äôs handwritten notes.

‚ÄúWe are pleased that in response to our inquiry, Director Haines has confirmed that the Intelligence Community and Department of Justice are assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago,‚Äù Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement to POLITICO. ‚ÄúThe DOJ affidavit, partially unsealed yesterday, affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done ‚Äî a process that should proceed in parallel with DOJ‚Äôs criminal investigation.‚Äù

The intelligence community‚Äôs review is likely to encompass whether any unauthorized individuals had access to the highly sensitive documents. The Justice Department previously raised alarms about the lax security of the records within Trump‚Äôs estate. That question could also bear on the criminal probe, as Justice Department counterintelligence investigators determine whether the highly classified records were compromised in any way."

‚Ä¢	$39 billion in manufacturing incentives

‚Ä¢	$2 billion for the legacy chips used in automobiles and defense systems

‚Ä¢	$13.2 billion in R&amp;D and workforce development

‚Ä¢	$500 million to provide international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities

Liz Cheney is in danger of losing her primary to a far-right candidate next week. A republican is guaranteed to win in November. So let's elect the one who stood up for what is right. She knew she would face republican backlash for opposing Trump. Yet still did the right thing.

170,democrats,Former President Donald Trump invokes Fifth Amendment rights and declines to answer questions from NY attorney general,"Curious to know if there are any attorneys or legal experts that can seriously provide clarity (or anyone else who would like to contribute of course). So on paper things look bad for Trump right now, the Georgia intimidation stuff, NY tax and inflating assets, January 6th, tax returns, taking WH documents, etc. However, time and time again he appeals court decisions or figures out a last minute legal loop hole and the case is dropped. What's not to say he just drags out the above mentioned cases as long as he can and if a decision is made he just appeals that decision to buy enough time for the 2024 election? 

My understanding is investigations have to be postponed for an active candidate anyways so it would be some time before the race concludes. Whilst if he is elected then all those cases just sit in limbo until he is out of office, if he ever decides to leave this time around. Is this theory legally plausible?"

45,democrats,Primaries,"This might be a question easily answered with the proper google phrasing, but so far I haven‚Äôt gotten anything solid. Is there any kind of law against crossing party lines in a primary election in order to alter the outcome of a party‚Äôs projected representative/senator/governor candidates and then voting for your respective party in the general election? I know of open and closed primaries but I guess is there an issue with a collective intent to change outcomes by simply voting?

I feel like it‚Äôs kind of cheating. But the crazies would stoop to that level without question and being the bigger person has proven ineffective thus far. I think that doing so could be an efficient method in thwarting undeniably seditious and totalitarian right wing fascists from gaining power. Vote against them in the Republican primaries to keep the most obedient Trumper from even being an option? I get that could alter the candidates of the Democratic party‚Äôs general elections candidate but either way a more progressive democrat losing to a moderate conservative (if there even are any) would be better for democracy than a Trump minion. Would the mythical moderate just fall in line to pacify the base? Would the base change direction with more, again elusive, moderates in power?

Lots of hypotheticals, but I guess the main question is whether or not it‚Äôs legal.  I see how it could be seen as deceitful and un-democratic, but given the current state of the union, ""Nobody pretends this act is constitutional, and nobody cares if it is or not."""

Today's focus is on the actions of former president Donald Trump himself, in particular, the 187 minutes from his Ellipse speech until the Twitter video of him telling the mob to go home. The Committee intends to set out its case that Trump ""was the sole person that could have called off the mob but chose not to"".

Reps. Elaine Luria and Adam Kinzinger will lead today's questioning. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson has tested positive for COVID, and is expected to participate remotely.

**Today's Witnesses:**

* Matthew Pottinger, former Deputy National Security Advisor
* Sarah Matthews, former Deputy White House Press Secretary

Both witnesses resigned immediately after the insurrection.
