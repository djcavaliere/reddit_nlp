She has the all of the above approach on Energy. That’s not good enough, that means the Democrats are correct that CO2 emissions will destroy up the planet. That means our civilization has to be destroyed. They’re also going after our food supply. All to meet climate change goals. It’s all junk science there’s thousands of scientists that say so. We are going to have to go through the work of educating the public. I believe that all of the above approach is the lazy way to approach it and it’s not a winning argument. I love Trump but I think he blew it big-time when they spoke about climate change. He bragged about how great he was doing and how he lowered carbon emissions which is loaded language. Trump has given speeches that tore apart the environmental impact from windmills and solar panels and doubted the CO2 apocalypse. I was disappointing to say the least. It’s CO2 but the left wingers know that if they call it carbon instead of carbon dioxide it sounds more dirty. Americans are paying a price now and they will listen to the skeptics and we need to start being skeptical start challenging and make the Democrats explain the science because I know they can. This chart destroys their argument"

162,Republican,"Trump: 'We are a failing nation' ""unselect committee of political hacks and thugs."" ""National Guard""","Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday outlined a hardline and harsh criminal justice agenda for the Republican Party, praising China's justice system, pushing for the death penalty for drug dealers and arguing the federal government should circumvent governors to use the National Guard to fight crime.
While the former President lauded the police, at one point calling police officers his heroes, what Trump did not mention in his first return to Washington since leaving office was the police that protected the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, or the deaths and injuries that stemmed from that attack. Trump instead told the audience ""our great police know what to do,"" but the country has to ""allow them to do it.""
Trump did call the House select committee investigating the attack -- which has been holding high-profile hearings for weeks -- the ""unselect committee of political hacks and thugs."" He attacked Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois -- the only two Republican on the committee -- by name and said that the committee ""really wants to damage me so I can no longer go back to work for you.""

On policing, Trump specifically called for a ""return to stop-and-frisk policies in cities,"" argued that cities should not ""strip (police) of their liability shield in any way shape or form"" and generally said the country should ""give our police back their authority, resources power and prestige.""
The speech before the America First Policy Institute's two-day summit was the first time Trump has returned to Washington since he left office. It came as Trump teases a third run for the White House in 2024, all while the congressional investigation of the January 6, 2021, insurrection triggered by his denial of the 2020 election results, plans more hearings in September.
Trump passingly mentioned 2024 in the speech, nodding to his belief that the next Republican president needs to back his criminal justice plans, but only acknowledged his own ambitions when he pushed the lie that he won his bid for a second term in 2020. He also did not mention some of the Republicans flirting with running in 2024, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence, who also appeared in Washington on Tuesday.
""I won a second time, did much better a second time. Did a lot better. Did a lot better. Very corrupt. I always said I ran the first time and I won. And then I ran a second time, and I did much better,"" he said, pushing the baseless claim the the 2020 election was stolen from him. ""What a disgrace it was. But we may just have to do it again. We have to straighten out our country.""
In another reference to the lies around the 2020 election, Trump argued that ""the radical left's anti-police narrative is a total lie.""
""Let's call it the big lie,"" he said, parroting what Democrats have called Trump's election lies. ""Have you ever heard that expression before? The big lie.""
Trump's DC trip also underscores his dramatic split with former Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump has publicly blamed for refusing to attempt to overturn voters' will by rejecting key states' electoral votes.
Pence has pushed back, saying earlier this year that ""Trump is wrong"" in claiming that he could overturn the results. He has in recent speeches urged Republicans to drop their grievances over 2020 and offer a forward-looking platform. Pence had been scheduled to speak Monday at the Heritage Foundation in DC, but that speech was postponed after his flight was diverted due to weather.

'We are a failing nation'

Much like his inauguration address in 2017, Trump struck a dour tone throughout the speech, painting a picture of a country riddled with crime, drugs and homelessness.
""We are a failing nation,"" Trump said.
""The dangerously deranged roam our streets with impunity. We are living in such a different country for one primary reason: There is no longer respect for the law and there certainly is no order. Our country is now a cesspool of crime,"" said Trump, at times mentioning specific high-profile crimes, many of which have been covered extensively by conservative media.

where the Chinese president told him about ""quick trials"" for drug criminals in China that he estimated sentenced people in ""two hours.""
""It sounds horrible, doesn't it? But those are the ones that don't have any problem. It doesn't take 15 years in court. It goes quickly,"" Trump said, before he endorsed a ""very strong death penalty for the people who sell drugs"" -- something he has argued for since he was president.
To combat crime, Trump argued that the next president needs to circumvent governors and deploy the National Guard and ""go beyond the governor,"" despite Republicans often arguing on behalf of state's rights.
""When governors refuse to protect their people, we need to bring in what is necessary anyway,"" Trump said, specifically arguing ""the next president needs to send the National Guard to the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago until safety can be restored.""
Trump also suggested the federal government needs to build large tent cities on the outskirts of some of the nation's largest urban centers and clear out current homeless camps. He said the government should ""create thousands and thousands of high quality tents"" at the ""outer reaches of the cities,"" and then bring in medical professionals, psychologists and psychiatrists to work with people.
Trump echoed Republican optimism that the 2022 midterms will be a standout year for the party, telling the audience that he believes the GOP is ""on the verge of a historic midterm election"" and has an ""incredible opportunity"" to in in 2022.
He added: ""I am here before you to begin to talk about what we must do to achieve that future when we win a triumphant victory in 2022 and when a Republican president takes back the White House in 2024, which I strongly believe will happen."""
